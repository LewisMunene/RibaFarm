## Problem Statement

The global agricultural sector faces significant challenges that disproportionately affect smallholder farmers in developing countries:

### Current Market Inefficiencies
- **Middleman Exploitation**: Traditional supply chains capture 30-50% of farm-gate value, leaving farmers with minimal profits
- **Limited Market Access**: Rural farmers lack direct connections to local and international buyers
- **Financial Exclusion**: Over 70% of smallholder farmers remain unbanked, lacking access to credit, insurance, and formal financial services

### Knowledge and Technology Gaps
- **Agricultural Information Asymmetry**: Farmers lack access to real-time market prices, weather data, and crop management best practices
- **Youth Disengagement**: Traditional farming education fails to engage tech-savvy younger generations
- **Low Adoption of Modern Practices**: Limited access to agricultural extension services and modern farming techniques

### Logistical and Infrastructure Challenges
- **Supply Chain Inefficiencies**: Poor coordination between production, processing, and distribution
